Question,Answer
"1. **Prioritization:** The document mentions several outstanding tasks.  Prioritize these tasks based on the information provided, justifying your choices.  Consider factors like impact on users, urgency, and dependencies.","Based on the provided document, here's a prioritized list of outstanding tasks, along with justifications:

1. **Sipariş Oluşturma Sorunu (Order Creation Issue):** This is the top priority.  The document explicitly states this issue impacts the stability of the order process and needs immediate attention.  The impact on users (inability to place orders) and the urgency of resolving this critical functionality make it the most important task.

2. **Amazon API Entegrasyonu (Amazon API Integration):** This is the second priority. While not directly impacting user functionality as severely as the order creation issue, the lack of Amazon API access prevents a significant feature from being implemented.  This integration is a dependency for future development and needs to be addressed before further progress can be made.  The 8-month delay highlights the urgency.

3. **Sunucu Transferi (Server Transfer):** This task is important for long-term stability and maintenance but is less urgent than the first two.  The development environment is currently hosted by the developers, and transferring it to the client is a necessary step, but it doesn't directly affect user-facing functionality.

4. **Shippo Etiket Satın Alma (Shippo Label Purchase) and FBA Dosya Girişi (FBA File Upload):** These are lower priority tasks.  While improving user experience, they are not critical for core functionality like order placement or Amazon integration.  They can be tackled after the higher-priority issues are resolved.


The prioritization is based on the impact on user experience, the urgency of the issue, and any dependencies between tasks.  The order creation issue has the most immediate and severe impact, followed by the Amazon API integration which blocks further development.  The server transfer is important for long-term stability, and the remaining tasks are enhancements that can wait."
"2. **Bug Severity:**  Describe the severity of the ""Sipariş Oluşturma Sorunu"" (Order Creation Issue). Explain why it's considered a high-priority issue.","The ""Sipariş Oluşturma Sorunu"" (Order Creation Issue) is a high-priority issue because it prevents some orders from being registered in the system when users create multiple orders consecutively.  This directly impacts the stability and reliability of the order process, making it a critical bug that needs immediate attention."
"3. **Dependency Management:** The ""Sunucu Transferi"" (Server Transfer) task is dependent on other actions.  What are these dependencies, and what is the potential impact of delays?","The ""Sunucu Transferi"" (Server Transfer) task depends on completing the necessary information exchange with Ardan Bey, as outlined in a previous meeting.  The document states that the server transfer cannot happen until the remaining missing information is completed.  Delays in providing this information will delay the server transfer."
4. **API Integration Issues:**  Explain the current status of the Shippo API integration and the Amazon API integration. What are the roadblocks preventing completion in each case?  What steps are needed to resolve these issues?,"**Shippo API Integration:** The Shippo API integration has been tested in a test environment, but the live environment integration and user flow are incomplete.  The next steps are to complete the live environment integration and user flow to enable direct Shippo label purchasing from the site.

**Amazon API Integration:**  The necessary access information (API key/token) for Amazon API integration has not been provided, despite a delay of 8 months.  The roadblock is the lack of Amazon API access.  Once the API access is provided, the following steps are needed:  parties will meet again, the tasks will be detailed, the technical scope will be clarified, and a new budget will be agreed upon before the integration process can begin."
5. **Testing:** The document mentions testing in the context of Shippo API integration.  What types of testing should be performed before deploying the Shippo integration to a live environment?  What are the potential risks of insufficient testing?,"The provided text mentions that Shippo API integration has been tested in a test environment.  However, it does not specify the types of testing performed.  Therefore, I cannot answer your question about the types of testing that *should* be performed before deploying to a live environment, nor the potential risks of insufficient testing based solely on this document."
6. **Payment & Scope:** The payment plan clearly separates bug fixes from new development.  What are the implications of requesting new features or modules after the initial payment?,The provided text states that new development requests or module additions are explicitly not included in the initial 950 USD payment.  Requesting these after the initial payment would require a separate agreement and a new budget.  Work on new features will only begin after this new payment is made.
7. **Communication Breakdown:** The Amazon API integration is delayed due to missing access information.  How could better communication have prevented this delay?  What communication strategies should be implemented to avoid similar situations in the future?,"The provided text states that Amazon API access information (API key/token) was not provided despite being due 8 months prior.  It doesn't detail the communication breakdown, only the result.  Therefore, I cannot answer how better communication could have prevented the delay or what communication strategies should be implemented to avoid similar situations."
"8. **Risk Assessment:** Identify at least three potential risks to the project's success based on the information provided.  For each risk, suggest a mitigation strategy.","Based on the provided text, here are three potential risks to the project's success and suggested mitigation strategies:

1. **Risk:**  The unresolved order creation issue in the system.  This prevents some orders from being processed, impacting the stability and usability of the system.

   **Mitigation Strategy:** Prioritize and immediately address the order creation bug.  This might involve dedicating a developer to focus solely on resolving this issue, potentially using debugging tools and logs to identify the root cause.  Thorough testing should follow any implemented fix.

2. **Risk:** The lack of Amazon API access information, delaying the Amazon API integration.  This delays a key feature and potentially impacts the project timeline and budget.

   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Actively pursue obtaining the necessary Amazon API access information.  This may involve direct communication with Amazon or the relevant contact person to expedite the process.  Develop a contingency plan, such as exploring alternative solutions or delaying the Amazon integration if access cannot be obtained promptly.

3. **Risk:**  The project's reliance on payment before commencing work.  If payment is delayed, the project will be delayed.

   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Establish clear payment milestones and deadlines with the client.  Consider a phased payment approach, releasing portions of the payment upon completion of specific milestones to incentivize timely progress and reduce the risk of project delays due to payment issues."
"9. **Shippo API:**  Assuming you have experience with APIs, describe the general steps involved in integrating the Shippo API into the system.  What are some potential challenges you might encounter during this integration?","I do not have experience interacting with real-world APIs or coding.  Therefore, I cannot describe the specific steps involved in integrating the Shippo API or predict the challenges."
"10. **File Upload (FBA):** Design a basic user interface (UI) for the FBA file upload feature.  Consider user experience and error handling.  What file formats would you support, and how would you validate the uploaded data?","The provided text mentions the need for a simple file upload interface for FBA shipping details, but it doesn't offer details on the UI design, supported file formats, or data validation.  Therefore, I don't know the answer to your question."
"These questions assess not only technical skills but also a candidate's ability to understand project requirements, manage dependencies, prioritize tasks, and communicate effectively.
